# ChicagoWardGeoJSON
this repository hosts a geojson converted version of Chicago's geographical ward dataset
as well as the file that handles the conversion.
the source csv can be found [here](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Ward-Precincts-2023-Map/atkq-s364)
while the owner of this repository is aware of the [geojson](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Wards-2023-/p293-wvbd/about_data) available, this was primarily in excercise in understanding geojson as a format
